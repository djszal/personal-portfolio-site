                <h3 id="career">Career</h3>
                    <p>Before entering the world of full stack development, I worked 8+ years within the construction industry as a project manager, where I gained experience managing various client projects from start to finish. While I enjoyed helping a client's project go from paper conceptualization to a tangible product while working with a team of specialized professionals, I loved being able to use various technologies to make each one successful. 
                    </p>
                    <p>With these technologies, I would become immensely focused while using scheduling software to ensure the projects were on track or with budgeting software to make sure budgets were being met or with becoming proficient with other applications to help streamline communications between all stakeholders. As my proficiency with these platforms grew, I enjoyed sharing my knowledge of them with other colleagues in order to help their career and projects be successful. </p>
                    <p>I soon found myself searching for ways to work more with technology in ways that were creative, challenging, team-oriented and benefited other people in various aspects of their lives. That search led me to completing a 3 month, full stack, web development program offered through Virginia Tech in order to jumpstart a career in the Tech industry.   </p>
                    <p>I look forward to utilizing the skills I've acquired through the program, along with my previous experience, and bring them to an organization where I can further grow professionally as a full stack developer and help an organization meet its goals. </p> <br>
